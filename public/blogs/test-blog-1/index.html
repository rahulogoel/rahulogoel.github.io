Paper\nAlso, CLAHE Enhancement is applied to reduce noise and improve image quality. Finally after training, DenseNet121 achieved the best performance among all the models evaluated using various metrics.\nDataset The ChestX-ray14 dataset is one of the largest collections of anterior-view pulmonary X-ray scan data. For this research, a total of 112,120 bilateral thoracic X-ray data were obtained from the dataset. The ChestX-ray14 dataset contains data of 14 disease classes and a no finding class from 30805 unique patients. These disease classes are Emphysema, Infiltration, Mass, Pleural Thickening, Pneumonia, Pneumothorax, Atelectasis, Edema, Effusion, Hernia, Cardiomegaly, Pulmonary Fibrosis, Nodule, and Consolidation. No finding means the 14 listed disease patterns are not found in the image.\nPreprocessing Steps The following steps were taken for preprocessing:\nCLAHE Enhancement Without CLAHE With CLAHE Contrast-limited adaptive histogram equalization (CLAHE) applied on all images to reduce noise and improving image quality. The tile size and clip limit are critical hyper-parameters for this method. An incorrect selection of hyper-parameters could have a big influence on the image quality. The optimal ones tileGridSize (10, 10) and the clip limit (3) were chosen here.\nData Balancing Before After As you can see in the above bar chart that the dataset is highly imbalanced as the No Finding class contains 60361 images which is about 53% of the whole dataset whereas Hernia contains only 227 images. And this imbalanced dataset further results in a high biased model predictions and poor performance for minority classes. So it is very important to first balance the dataset with the help of techniques like Undersampling and Oversampling to make it balanced then proceed for training.\nThe following steps were taken to balance the dataset:\nAs the dataset was highly imbalanced, an Undersampling technique was applied by Randomly Removing examples from over-represented classes to balance the dataset. This was done for each class individually, ensuring fairness in a multi-label setting.\nAfter undersampling , Oversampling of dataset was done by using Data Augmention with the help of Albumentations library to increase diversity. The following transformations were applied to the images:\nHorizontalFlip RandomRotate90 VerticalFlip Sharpen (with different probability of transform after each iteration) Finally, all images were resized to 224x224 pixels to ensure uniform input dimensions for the model, optimizing performance and compatibility with the chosen architecture.\nThese steps helped both balance the dataset and also resizing it for further training of our model.\nModel Training The model training was done on Kaggle’s TPU VM v3-8 with 330GB of RAM.\nTrained several deep learning models with a 70:15:15 split as the train:validation:test set which includes:\nAlexNet DenseNet121 InceptionResNetv2 MobileNetV2 Used binary_crossentropy as a multi-label loss function, with sigmoid as activation and Adam as its optimizer.\nVarious Evaluation Metrics were calculated besides Accuracy and Loss to assess overall performance which includes:\nAUC F1-score Precision Recall Results Finally, after training, DenseNet121 achieved the best performance among all the models evaluated using various metrics.\nProblems When finalizing this work, I read this Kaggle’s discussion which redirects to a Blog post by a radiologist stating that this dataset is in fact has some problems like:\nCompared to human visual assessment, the labels in the ChestXray14 dataset are inaccurate, unclear, and often describe medically unimportant findings.\nThese label problems are internally consistent within the data, meaning models can show good test-set performance, while still producing predictions that don’t make medical sense.\nThe above combination of problems mean the dataset as defined currently is not fit for training medical systems, and research on the dataset cannot generate valid medical claims without significant additional justification.\nAcknowledgments I read several research papers to gain insights into different methodologies used in medical research involving deep learning:\nChestX-ray8: Hospital-scale Chest X-ray Database and Benchmarks on Weakly-Supervised Classification and Localization of Common Thorax Diseases, Xiaosong Wang et al High-precision multiclass classification of lung disease through customized MobileNetV2 from chest X-ray images, F.J.M.
