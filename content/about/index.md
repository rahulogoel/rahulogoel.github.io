ðŸ‘‹ Hi I'm Rahul Goel! I'm a Data Science enthusiast pursuing my Bachelor's in Computer Science at the University of Delhi. I like working with data - exploring patterns, building machine learning models, and deriving meaningful insights that drive real-world impact.

I always seek opportunities to diversify my skill set by exploring various fields that would complement each other in unexpected ways, allowing me to make a meaningful impact. So I engrained this idea to my lifestyle.
